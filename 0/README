The 'K' is drawn using ordinary triangle primitives, and the 'R' is drawn using
a single triangle strip. All the coordinates are hard-coded, but note that the
arch of the 'R' is generated at runtime; it is possible to adjust the
smoothness of the arch by changing the number of points generated to any
positive odd integer.

The wavy color effect is achieved by creating a new varying, fPosition, which
the vertex shader sets to the position of each vertex, as given in vPosition.
The fragment shader applies some simple math to the interpolated value of
fPosition to get a scaling factor, which it multiplies against the input
baseColor for the final result.
