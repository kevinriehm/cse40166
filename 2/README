How to Run
----------

Open the 'orrey.html' file in the '2' directory.

This has the shaders in separate files, so be sure to set permissions to allow
AJAX access to those files.

Explanation
-----------

The actual physical attributes of the planets are stored in an array, defined
in the function bound to window.onload; these are then scaled down in a very
ad-hoc manner in the render_planet() function in order to make all the bodies
not only fit within the viewport but also are all visible at the same time. If
even their relative sizes were maintained correctly, only the Sun would be
large enough to cover even a single pixel, so instead they are scaled
non-linearly to make them all visible.

Instead of an explicit stack of matrices, the current matrix is simply passed
to recursive invocations of render_planet() (implicitly making use of the call
stack). This is only actually needed to render the Moon, to make sure its orbit
around the Earth follows the Earth's orbit around the Sun.

Although the assignment says to operate at 30 fps, it is not actually possible
to control the framerate that the browser renders at when using
window.requestAnimationFrame(). Hence, I interpret this as simply meaning 30
days-per-second, and do the appropriate calculations needed to implement this
independent of the actual framerate.
