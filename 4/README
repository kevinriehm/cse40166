How to Run
----------

Open the 'objViewer.html' file in the '4' directory.

Explanation
-----------

The texture coordinates have to be flipped on the Y-axis in order to match
with OpenGL's texture coordinate system; this is done when parsing the
coordinates from the .obj file. Other than that, the texture coordinates
follow the same code pathway as the vertex coordinates and vertex normals.

Light information (position and colors) are passed into the vertex shader via
uniforms.
