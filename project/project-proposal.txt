Final Project Proposal

My proposal is to write an ocean surface simulator: using WebGL, I will render
animated waves (extending to the horizon) with realistic lighting from the
sun. The user will be able to adjust the camera and other parameters of the
rendering.

Goals for features and configurable options:

 - Camera direction and zoom

 - Wave size and roughness

 - Sunlight direction and intensity

 - Wind speed and direction

 - Water and sky color

For the wave simulation, I plan on using an algorithm I found
(http://people.clemson.edu/~jtessen/papers_files/coursenotes2002.pdf) the
basic idea of which is to treat ocean waves as a statistical system, where a
set of randomized frequencies is generated and a heightfield for the waves are
then calculated via an inverse Fourier transform. This seems to be a popular
algorithm for simulating oceans in both movies and video games.

I also plan to put some effort into making a decent shading model for the
water, so that it actually looks like an ocean, not just a bouncing blue blob.

It is hard to be certain how much work this will entail, but, time permitting,
other possible additions might include a textured skybox, reflections of that
skybox in the water, atmospheric effects (fog), or objects bobbing in the
water.

The biggest challenge I am anticipating is making it run efficiently, since it
will involve computing that inverse Fourier transform for every frame of
animation, in addition to rendering a sufficient number of triangles to keep
the animation smooth.
