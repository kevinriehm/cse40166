How to Run
----------

Open the 'bspline.html' file in the '3' directory.

This has the shaders in separate files, so be sure to set permissions to allow
AJAX access to those files.

Explanation
-----------

The B-spline interpolation actually happens in the vertex shader: successive
sets of four control points are passed in via uniforms, and the interpolation
variable is passed in as a vertex attribute. This offloads the spline
calculation to the GPU and skips the uploading of all the interpolated points
each frame, although it does require multiple calls to drawArrays() (one per
spline segment).
