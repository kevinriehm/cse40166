How to Run
----------

Open the 'pingpong.html' file in the '1' directory.

Explanation
-----------

The ball is rendered as a triangle fan (whose vertex positions are
automatically generated), and the paddle is a triangle strip of just two
triangles.

The two buttons on the left move the paddle back and forth (as indicated by the
buttons' arrows), while the two buttons on the right increase and decrease the
speed of the ball. As a convenience, the arrow keys can be used instead: left
and right for the paddle, up and down to increase and decrease the speed of the
ball, respectively.

At the start the ball is placed at a random position along the top of the
gameplay area, and given a random starting vector (the initial speed is always
the same). Some effort has been made to avoid boring ball directions; namely,
those that are too steep (where the ball just goes straight up and down in the
same spot) and those that are too gradual (where the ball spends most of its
time bouncing back and forth between the side walls). The color of the ball is
also dynamically modified to reflect its speed.

Centered at the bottom of the layout is the player's score, which is updated on
each bounce. When the game is over, all the controls are disabled,  and the
canvas is no longer updated; to play another game, simply refresh the page.
